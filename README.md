# Cafe_Web
This application was designed to elevate the overall charm and desirability of a café.

This application was developed as part of the project I had to undertake to earn my bachelor's degree. Through this application, customers of the café can either explore the café's menu online or create their own customized coffee blends. Additionally, they can submit short anecdotes, which the website administrator will review and later feature on a dedicated stories page, followed by printing them on cardboard cups. In addition, the customer has the capability to generate a QR code associated with the custom coffee blend they've created. This QR code can then be used within the café. Furthermore, if the customer desires, they can take a quiz, and based on their preferences, the web application will recommend a coffee from the menu.

To create this application, I used the following external resources: SendGrid API, EmailJS API, Typeform, and GoQR API.

The programming languages were: C# with JS, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.

I used the ASP.NET Core framework version 6.0 with Razor Pages as the primary software technology.

The database is a local one: MSSQLLocalDB, implemented with the EntityFramework ORM and the LINQ language.
